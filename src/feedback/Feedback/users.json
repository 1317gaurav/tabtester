    "description": "Hi Guys!\r\n\r\nI wanted to take the time to thank all of you for being great team members,  for your willingness to help and for making the last few months and the whole onboarding a lot easier and less weird for me!\r\n\r\nI really appreciate that everyone is regularly checking in and asking if there is anything they can do for me. There is not one single person in the team who hasn't offered me their help yet which is really remarkable - especially as I know how busy you all are!\r\n\r\nI hope I can meet all of you soon and look forward to working with you in person when we can finally go back into the office :)\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nCedric\r\n",
