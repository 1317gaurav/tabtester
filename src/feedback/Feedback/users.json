    "description": "Hi Guys!\r\n\r\nI wanted to take the time to thank all of you for being great team members,  for your willingness to help and for making the last few months and the whole onboarding a lot easier and less weird for me!\r\n\r\nI really appreciate that everyone is regularly checking in and asking if there is anything they can do for me. There is not one single person in the team who hasn't offered me their help yet which is really remarkable - especially as I know how busy you all are!\r\n\r\nI hope I can meet all of you soon and look forward to working with you in person when we can finally go back into the office :)\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nCedric\r\n",

    "description": "Hi Katherine, \r\nThank you for helping Liane and me with our million questions about the advertiser side of the business! By improving our knowledge of the advertiser's experience and goals, you have helped us to better educate our publishers on how Taboola works and how their RPMs are influenced. We naturally avoid talking about CPCs and Feed content with our publishers, but we are definitely in a better position to tackle these questions and concerns. \r\nYou are clearly an expert in technical analysis and your customers' business needs - an asset to your AM team! \r\nThank you!
