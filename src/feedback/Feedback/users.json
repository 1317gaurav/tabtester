I vividly remember my visit to London office last year and the challenges people in different business teams was facing while working the TI team. We have walked a long way together solving each of those challenges and taking our relationship to new heights every day. It was possible because of Arthur and his team's positive outlook for TI and Working with Arthur and his team is always a pleasure. Thank you Arthur!",
